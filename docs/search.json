    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals‚Äô preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs‚Äô least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "My research aims to determine agronomic, genetic, human, and social aspects of sustainably reducing wheat yield gaps. Agronomically, two projects address the management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to increase winter wheat grain yield while maintaining (or increasing) grain protein concentration (GPC), including (i) late-season N application and (ii) in-season N by cultivar interactions. A third project is a statistical approach to determine seeding rates that maximize yield and reduce yield variability as dependent on yield-environment. A fourth project characterizes the genetic architecture of winter wheat traits that contribute to yield GxE. From the human and social components, I am conducting key informant and structured discussion analyses with major players across the wheat value chain to identify indicators and metrics needed for the development of sustainable bread."

    "text": "Abstract\nLate-season nitrogen (N) application has been proposed to boost grain yield and grain protein concentration (GPC) in cereals; however, its effects on bread and durum wheat have been inconsistent in field experiments. We performed a meta-analysis to (i) assess the effect of N applications to wheat after flag leaf visible (GS 37) on grain yield and GPC; and to assess the variation in these responses with (ii) N fertiliser management, (iii) environmental factors, and (iv) physiological traits. We searched ‚ÄòAgronomy Journal‚Äô, ‚ÄòCrop Science‚Äô, ‚ÄòEuropean Journal of Agronomy‚Äô, and ‚ÄòField Crops Research‚Äô for articles published between 1980 and 2021 that allowed for a direct comparison of wheat yield and GPC between N application after GS 37 to an otherwise equally managed crop that received basal N fertilisation. We also collected other traits such as stover biomass and N uptake at plant maturity, and dough rheological properties, when available. The search resulted in 38 articles that, in addition to one unpublished trial from our group, evaluated 542 pairwise comparisons in 127 environments. Across studies, grain yield ranged from 1.15 to 10.63 Mg ha-1 and showed a negative relation with GPC, which ranged from 65 to 189 g kg-1. Late-season N fertilisation was neutral for grain yield (I2, proportion of the overall variance due to variation in real effects rather than chance, 26.2%) and increased GPC with a pooled estimate of 3.96%. The response of GPC was heterogeneous (I2 = 84%), suggesting the need for exploration of potential moderators of the response. Meta-regression suggested that increasing the proportion of late N relative to the total available N positively associated to increases in GPC, and the residuals of this analysis suggested that later applications increased GPC response, with no effect of N fertiliser source or placement. Environments with low temperature, high photothermal quotient, and long duration of the critical period associated with greater GPC response to late-season N applications. The relative response of GPC to late fertilisation correlated with the relative response of both stover N uptake and nitrogen concentration in stover at maturity, but not with stover biomass at maturity. Alveogram index and dough extensibility increased when late-season N increased GPC. Enhancing GPC through late N applications should consider associations between management, environmental, and physiological factors. Future research should focus on forecasting GPC response to late N, based on GPC response drivers identified in the current research."

    "text": "Abstract\nContext: Owing to the interaction between genotype and environment (G x E), identifying traits to increase wheat yield and grain protein concentration simultaneously or increasing one without affecting the other remains a challenge. Phenotypic plasticity is an insightful perspective to understand G x E. Objective: To explore the relations of wheat yield and grain protein concentration in response to N input and its physiological basis from the perspective of phenotypic plasticity. Method: We established a factorial experiment combining 14 winter wheat cultivars and four N fertilization rates (0, 45, 90 and 135 kg ha-1) in eight environments. We analyzed the interaction of cultivar and N combining a phenotypic plasticity framework and a three-phase model of grain yield and protein response to N input. The phases are: phase I, N supply limits both yield and grain protein; phase II, N supply limits grain protein but not yield; and phase III, N supply does not limit yield or grain protein concentration Results: Grain yield plasticity was positively associated to yield in high-yielding environments without N limitations (phase II) with no cost in low yielding environments, and associated to harvest index. Grain protein plasticity was a positively associated to protein in high protein environments without N limitations (phase III). Plasticity of grain protein concentration was negatively associated to grain number m-2, resulting in moderate negative association of protein plasticity and yield. Grain C:N ratio associated weakly and positively with yield plasticity and strongly and negatively for grain protein plasticity. Conclusion: This work proposes a yield-protein plasticity framework combined with a three-phase model that allows to disclose G √ó N interactions. Under our experimental conditions, we identified physiological mechanisms associated to yield and protein plasticity. Implications: Yield and protein plasticity can contribute guiding grower‚Äôs cultivar selection towards high yield plasticity cultivars when aiming to high yield with acceptable protein levels or high protein plasticity cultivars to ensure high protein at the expense of lower yields. Yield plasticity brings opportunity to breed for high yielding cultivars while maintaining grain protein concentration. Accuracy of N recommendations models and mechanistic crop models can be improved by accounting for G √ó N interactions through plasticity of yield and grain protein."
